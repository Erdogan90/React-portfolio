# Hi, I'm Erdogan! üëã

I'm currently on a 16 week bootcamp course with the School of code.

Over the past 12 weeks I've learned a lot!

- Frontend
- Backend
- JS
- React
- Css
- UX/UI
- 

Those are just a few of them. 

One of the most interesting lessons I had was on UX/UI.
I found the lesson so Fascinating. 

But the question is what really is UX/UI design? And how can we be better at it?

This is the question I hope to answer with this Repo.

As well as show some of my work so far in understanding user, Building and creating low/high Fidelity work.

# What is UX and what is UI

_‚ÄúUser experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user‚Äôs interaction with the company, its services, and its products.‚Äù_

The term user experience originated in the early 1990s at Apple when cognitive psychologist Donald Norman joined the staff.

He stated the above quote.

UX applies to anything that can be experienced‚Äîbe it a website, a coffee machine, or a visit to the supermarket. 

The ‚Äúuser experience‚Äù part refers to the interaction between the user and a product or service

## What about UI?

UI stands for User Interface

Unlike UX, user interface design is a strictly digital term. A user interface is the point of interaction between the user and a digital device or product

I've added an image below to show us all the difference between the two.

If you want to see the difference between the 2 in more detail i would recommend

# So what? 

Well let me tell you what.

Very often these 2 get mixed up or people do parts of each one or part of only one and see that as 
"My work on the Design and research of the application is now complete".

As new Developers, future UX designers or future UI Designers we really do need to pay attention and ensure we are doing the design and research
of an application or software it's justice. 

We need to investigate and research correctly to each point to ensure we get exactly what we need to help us with every project.

### Being better.

I want to give what I believe to be the basic principles of UX and UI Design. To help Any new or existing Developers and Designers.

- Focusing on the user more than the project
- Asking every question you believe to be relevant 
- Questioning the feeling and journey the user needs to take and wants to take.
- Not Jumping to Wireframing and prototyping.
- Researching into expectations for the project from both the Client and the User
- Nothing the user states is irrelevant 
- Being able to walk away from a low fidelity wireframe and starting it again. 

I have found 2 fantastic articles that Really do break the process of UX design down.

## The Project

This currently may not be a project that we can all Clone down and edit few lines of code But this is a project for us all to ADD Principles and Articles.
Or even Comment and share to Make the future of UX?UI Design even better
