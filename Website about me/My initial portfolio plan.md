# My own web plan

Below we have 3 different staged plans. 

1. Purpose of the website and aim
2. User experience and feel
3. Plan of action

## Purpose of website and aim.

This website will be created and generated to be about mer.
I'm viewing the task at hand as something more than a CV.
More like a CV for life.
I want the website to answer questions more than "Why should anyone hire me?"
Whoever views and reads the website should feel as if I'm the correct person for whatever they might need. I want anyone and everyone to be able to view and interact with the website and still demand more.
Keeping the website clean and simple will ensure people will want more.


## User experience and feel.

As I mentioned above I'm looking for the user to feel as if it's more than a website about me. Almost like an advert about me. 
The website should make an individual want me for any task at hand whether it be working on coding projects or joining them for a game of football.
Users should feel as if the simplicity of the website is to ensure their focus was kept on the text and images.
Users should feel a sense of engagement with every scroll and this will be achieved by adding shadows around images and text. 
User experience should be smooth and clean, give them everything they might need to know and more if they want it. 
Dividing the website into multiple sections will help with users not feeling overwhelmed with information. 

## Plan of action

- Research into personal websites
- Research into what user's want from personal websites
- Create a user persona
- create user story map
- Create a low fidelity framework.
- Select a colour palette
- Create a medium or high fidelity framework
- Research images and information you want on the site
- Check back with step 1 and 2
- Review all above steps
- If happy start a plan for the HTML and Code
